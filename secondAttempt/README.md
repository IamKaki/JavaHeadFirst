In this chapter I learnt how to create objects and use the objects to access variable and methods in other classes.
I have learnt that there is a difference between normal variables and instance variables.
I can now cofortable create objects and use them to invoke methods from other classes.
The BE THE COMPILER execises were the easiest for me followed by the CODE MAGNETS exercises.
The POOL PUZZLE kicked my ass and the WHO AM I quiz was a bit confusing.
All in all I enjoyed chapter 2.
