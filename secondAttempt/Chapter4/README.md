This was an interesting chapter.
I learned about;
1. Encapsulation
2. Using setters
3. Using getters
4. The difference between instance and local variables
5. Java is pass-by-value. Meaning pass-by-copy
The only real challenges were the exercises especially the poolpuzzle and the mixed messages.
I also need to dig more on using the setter and getter plus on iterations.
Other than that everything good.
