This is an attempt at learning the fundamentals of programming through an introduction to the Java programming language.
I am a newbie eager to learn and make awesome software solutions for my future clients and employers.
I will be using a vim text editor while learning to code in thisbook and I will at the same time be learning the terminal.
I want to learn how to write scripts using bash and also to master HTML/CSS.
I am aware that the journey up ahead is long and hard, but I am determined to learn.
My new routine is: Eat, Sleep, Study, Repeat!
